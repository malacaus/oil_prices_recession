Economic recessions generally correlate with a decline in oil prices, likely due to decreased industrial activity and consumer demand.

The following data was pulled from Kaggle. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between Brent Oil Prices and US economic depression.

From the plot, you can observe the relationship between Brent Oil Prices and US economic depression periods (highlighted in red). During the 2007-2009 recession, Brent oil prices initially peaked but then sharply declined, reflecting reduced demand due to economic downturn. In the 2020 recession, prices also dropped significantly, indicating a similar pattern where economic stress leads to lower oil prices. This relationship suggests that economic recessions generally correlate with a decline in oil prices, likely due to decreased industrial activity and consumer demand.
